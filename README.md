# wireless_antenna_for_biomedical_uses
The aim of this dissertation is the theoretical mathematical study, the simulation and
finally the physical design of a custom wireless energy transfer antenna for biomedical
applications. The present work starts from a high level of abstraction, continues
drawing theoretical conclusions on a physical level and ends with the final design and
construction of an antenna that meets the requirements of efficient wireless power
transmission.
The purpose is not just the field analysis of the phenomenon of wireless power
transmission, but also the precise simulation and, as mentioned above, ultimately the
physical construction of such a device. The design of this specific antenna is based on
research conducted at Stanford University [1], where the geometry analysed in the
present dissertation is proposed as optimal for biomedical applications. Numerical
simulation methods (MATLAB), and more specifically finite time difference methods
(FDTD) were utilized. In addition, as part of the dissertation, a software platform was
created to calculate the ideal weights of 3x3 dipole mesh, as a function of: a) the
structure of the tissue of the area being simulated (cardiac or pelvic area), and b) the
angle at which the radiation strikes to the receiver.
Using the data generated based on numerical methods, an antenna that satisfies the
desired performance requirements was designed and simulated. Both the physical
design of the antenna and its simulation were done using FDTD.
Finally, the design files produced through FDTD were exported and converted into
construction files (gerber), in order to physically implement the antenna design. The
construction was successfully done in a factory and the results are attached to the
corresponding chapter. Completing the dissertation, the following has been done: a)
thorough study and analysis of phenomena of interest, b) development of fully
functional design assistance software in MATLAB, c) physical design of a compatible
antenna in FDTD simulation of its operation in a multilayer environment, and d)
construction of the printed circuit board of the dipole antenna as designed in FDTD.
